     * default branch if no other branches match.

     * ```ts
     * import { RunnableBranch } from "langchain/schema/runnable";
     *
     * const branch = RunnableBranch.from([
     *   [(x: number) => x > 0, (x: number) => x + 1],
     *   [(x: number) => x < 0, (x: number) => x - 1],
     *   (x: number) => x
     * ]);
     * ```
     * @param branches An array where the every item except the last is a tuple of [condition, runnable]
     *   pairs. The last item is a default runnable which is invoked if no other condition matches.
     * @returns A new RunnableBranch.
